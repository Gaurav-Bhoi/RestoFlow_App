# Infrastructure implementation and verification

Verified on 11 October 2026. User-directed mock setup remains active; this is not a claim of verified production OTA operation.

## Commands executed and outcomes

Read-only inspection included package.json/package-lock, TypeScript and entrypoints, Android Gradle/native/resource files, iOS Podfile/project/scheme/plist/delegate, navigation/auth/persistence/localization and git status. Existing uncommitted work was preserved. Package versions/compatibility were checked with npm metadata, installed source and primary vendor documentation.

During implementation, initial Jest execution exposed an ESM transform issue in Immer; Jest now transforms the Redux dependencies and all tests pass. Initial TypeScript/header typing and native fingerprint inspection buffer issues were corrected before final checks. The default Node test runner's isolated subprocess execution was unsuitable in the managed environment; infrastructure tests run with --test-isolation=none and report all seven tests. Those implementation checks do not stand in for native OTA testing.

The existing Gradle toolchain emits AGP deprecation and AsyncStorage KSP/Kotlin alignment warnings. Compilation succeeds. Native iOS compile, release binary execution, signing verification, real backend acceptance and end-to-end OTA isolation remain unverified. Source-map upload and production monitoring remain unconfigured because no monitoring service exists.
